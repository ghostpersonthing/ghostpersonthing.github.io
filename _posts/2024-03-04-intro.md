Hello!

Welcome to Quarter Cost, a blog in which I review movies from my local charity shop's 4-for-Â£1 bargin bin. My name is Edgar, and this is a short introduction to the blog itself as well as serving as a test post to make sure Jekyll works properly!

This blog will start in full next week, once I get the formatting and domain figured out. Until then, take this intro post as a promise of blogging yet to come!
